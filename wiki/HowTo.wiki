= Introduction =

Let me start with a warning:

*This mod is not for the faint of heart, you will have to modify critical system configs and if you mess this up, you might brick your drone!*

If you have some experience with RC, soldering and basic knowledge of using terminal read on! If not, stick with flying your drone with your favourite iDevice :)

= Notes =

This mod currently *only works* with AR.Drone firmware *version 1.3.3*. If you want to use it, you have to downgrade your drone to this version. We must wait until Parrot releases the sources for the new firmwares to compile the tools for the latest version!
