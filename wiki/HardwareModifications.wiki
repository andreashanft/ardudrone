#summary This page sums up any hardware modifications and soldering that has to be done

= 2. Hardware modifications =

== Drone ==

Remove the rubber protector from the USB service port on the bottom.

Done.

:)

== Cable ==

The first thing we need is the cable to connect the Arduino over the FTDI Breakout to the drone. For this we take the Mini-USB Type B plug with a bit of cable left to it (depending on where you want to place the Arduino and Receiver on the drone). Cut the cable in two and connect/soldier the molex plug to the open end of the Mini B part. Note: Keep the other end, if you bought another molex connector you can put together a USB-Flash-Cable for emergency with it!

== Arduino ==

=== Header ===

Soldier a 6-pin header to the short end of the Arduino. This will be used to connect it to the FTDI Breakout Board to either flash it or talk to the drone.

=== Input ===

For the signals, the Arduino has 13 pins (numbered 1 - 13) of wich we need 6, one for each channel of your RC Receiver. Soldier the signal outputs of your receiver to any of the numbered pins on the arduino.

The Arduino supplies +5V on the *VCC* pin and (-) on any of the free *GND* pins. How your receiver accepts power highly dependend on the actual model, please check your manual for exact instructions for that!
